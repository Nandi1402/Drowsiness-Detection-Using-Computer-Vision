# Drowsiness Detection in Automobile Drivers

This project implements a **real-time computer vision system** that detects driver drowsiness using deep learning (CNN, VGG19, YOLOv3, Violaâ€“Jones). The system monitors eyes and mouth activity, computes drowsiness metrics (PERCLOS, blink frequency, yawn detection), and triggers alerts to prevent accidents.
